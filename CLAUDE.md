This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Login Lockdown is a Craft CMS 5 plugin that protects login forms from brute force attacks by tracking failed login attempts per IP address and temporarily blocking access after a configurable threshold.

**Stack:** Craft CMS 5.8+ / PHP 8.2+

## Common Commands

```bash
composer run check-cs           # Check code style (ECS)
composer run fix-cs             # Fix code style issues
composer run phpstan            # Run static analysis (PHPStan level 4)
```

### Event Flow

1. **Failed Login Detection**: Plugin listens to `UsersController::EVENT_LOGIN_FAILURE`
2. **Attempt Recording**: `ProtectionService::recordFailedAttempt()` stores attempt in `loginlockdown_login_attempts`
3. **Threshold Check**: If attempts exceed `maxAttempts` within `attemptWindow`, IP is blocked
4. **Block Enforcement**: `Application::EVENT_BEFORE_ACTION` intercepts login POST requests from blocked IPs
5. **Notifications**: `NotificationService` sends email/Pushover alerts when IPs are blocked

### Settings with Environment Variables

All settings support `$ENV_VAR` syntax. The Settings model has paired properties:
- Raw property (e.g., `$enabled`) - stores the value as entered (may be env var reference)
- Parsed getter (e.g., `getEnabledParsed()`) - resolves env vars and returns typed value

### Database Tables

- `loginlockdown_login_attempts` - Failed login attempts with IP, username, user agent
- `loginlockdown_blocked_ips` - Currently blocked IPs with expiration time

### Proxy-Aware IP Detection

`ProtectionService::getClientIp()` checks headers in order: `CF-Connecting-IP` → `X-Forwarded-For` → `X-Real-IP` → `REMOTE_ADDR`
